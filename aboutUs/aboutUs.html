        How many times  do you have to fill in books when checking for work?
        That's where <strong>The Mole</strong> comes in. Technically <strong>The Mole</strong> is a platform 
        that tends to make management much better and easier. It is 
        designed to help you keep attendance records of an organisation or 
        institute's personnel.

        The app is geared to solving the problem ok keeping track of attendance traffic of
        personnel scheduling and planning more so for an organisation and companies programs.
        Basicallly this is the app for any organisationthat requires a lot of planning and attendance tracking of their
         workers.
         <p>
         It would be applicable in a school where teachers attendanceis tracked by the employer.
         Tracking of teachers attendance in classes has been attempted by use of roll calls card scanners and biometric scanners
         this has not been so efficient as it is expensive to maintain like buying of printing materials ans card scanners and human inefficiency.
         Roll calls on the other hand are cumbersome having to go through large amounts of data and papers that tend to lose a lot of time.
         </p>
         Mole provides a solution to all these problems.
         An organisation or an institution will be able to keep track of overall attendance of its employees and upload schedules to all involved members
         it creates a communication pathway to all subject parties.
         It deals with the problem of forgetfulness by sending frequent reminders but best of all it is cost free.

         <p>
         The mole will consist of a mobile app and a website.
         In the website the organisation will sign in as a member.
         The organisationwill get a unique code that all its members will use to login into the application.
         The head of the organisationor institute will be the one to recieve the code and share it with all the members.
         The Admin will be able to set the parameters that the organisation will need.
         All the members will have to sign in through the organisation code and they will be able to enter their own personal details. 
         After the registration all the members will be redirected back to the app where the programs will be displayed according to 
         the organisation setup.
         </p>
         
         <h2 class="example">
             <strong>FOR EXAMPLE</strong>
         </h2>

         For a school the teacher will see their personal timetables according to their specific time and classes.
         There will be a reminder about ten minutes before a class begins.
         a teacher can also add their personal reminders. 
         I mportant school events and programmes set by the admin will be highlighted
         in the teachers calender

         <h3 class="qr">
             <strong>THE QR CODE SCANNER</strong> 
         </h3>

         Basically, we will make the app cost free as one will be scanning a QR code 
         printed on a piece of paper at any place that an organisation that will want 
         to keep track of the attendance traffic .A QR code will be provided for scanning 
         at specific areas.The admin will be able to check the attendance of the expected
         members from the school's personal and there will be a graph that will be able to
         analyse the attendance traffic of the day, week, and month basically, giving all the 
         information it needs for the attendance of the expected members.
         <p>
         Being cost free and saving hours of checking all the paperwork of attendance, you 
         can now do that by the look of the eye this makes it convenient and easy for any organisation 
         that hes many employees involved.
         </p>
