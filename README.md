The Mole Is a project I worked on that would help my school and others to help track teachers class attendance,
which proved to be an inssue in Kenyan Schools. The website is where schools would sign up themsleves and add teachers onto there platform.
They would also set classes up for techers and veiw there attendace as a report and on a graph.
The app is where teachers would log in and scan qr codes that would be placed on each individual class and updated there attendance status on the database.
I worked on a big part of the idea and plan, but due to limited resources I wasn't able to bring it to full completion.
